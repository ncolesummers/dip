# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, safe, and collaborative community for
everyone.

This Code applies to all project spaces (repository, issues, pull requests,
discussions, docs, community chat) and when individuals are representing the
project in public spaces.

## Our Standards

Positive behaviors include:

- Showing empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- Using inclusive language and assuming good intent

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments (related to identity,
  background, or personal characteristics)
- Trolling, insulting or demeaning remarks, and personal or political attacks
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Threats or incitement of violence; doxxing or publication of othersâ€™ private
  information
- Sustained disruption of discussions, issues, or reviews; spam

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of
representing the project include using an official project email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards.
Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code, and may
temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns:

1. Prefer private contact. Email the maintainers at [nate@ncolesummers.com] or
   use any listed private contact method in `SECURITY.md` if applicable.
2. If a private contact is unavailable, you may open an issue titled "Code of
   Conduct: Confidential" with minimal details and request a maintainer to
   establish a private channel. Do not disclose sensitive details publicly.

Reports should include:

- Your contact information (optional)
- Names of individuals involved and, if possible, links to any relevant context
  (issues/PRs/comments)
- A description of what happened and when

We will respect confidentiality as much as possible and will only share details
with those who need to know to address the report.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these community-impact guidelines when determining
consequences for any action they deem to be in violation of this Code:

1. Correction
   - Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
     unprofessional or unwelcome.
   - Consequence: A private, written warning and clarification of expectations.

2. Warning
   - Community Impact: A single incident or series of actions that violate the
     Code.
   - Consequence: A written warning with consequences for continued behavior.

3. Temporary Ban
   - Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including
     sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - Consequence: A temporary ban from interaction or collaboration for a set
     period of time.

4. Permanent Ban
   - Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation or harassment, or
     aggression/hostility toward a protected class.
   - Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
     community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from community best practices and inspired by
the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
If you adopt this for your own project, please review and tailor contact and
enforcement details for your context.
