# ADR-004: Use Grafana for Visualization

## Status

Accepted

## Context

With Prometheus collecting metrics from our microservices (ADR-003), we need a powerful visualization layer that can:

- **Create intuitive dashboards** for different stakeholders (developers, operations, business)
- **Support multiple data sources** beyond just Prometheus for future expansion
- **Enable alerting workflows** with visual configuration and testing
- **Provide self-service capabilities** allowing teams to create their own dashboards
- **Support templating and variables** for dynamic, reusable dashboards
- **Offer strong access control** for multi-tenant or team-based usage

Our visualization requirements include:
- Real-time monitoring dashboards for operations
- SLO/SLI tracking dashboards for reliability
- Business metrics dashboards for stakeholders
- Debugging dashboards for incident response
- Capacity planning visualizations for infrastructure

The solution must integrate seamlessly with our Prometheus metrics while remaining flexible enough to incorporate logs, traces, and other data sources in the future.

## Decision

We will use Grafana as our primary visualization platform for metrics and observability data.

Implementation approach:
1. **Deploy Grafana** with Prometheus as the primary data source
2. **Create standard dashboards** for each service following consistent patterns
3. **Implement dashboard-as-code** using Grafana provisioning for version control
4. **Establish dashboard organization** with folders for different concerns
5. **Configure alerting rules** with visual threshold configuration
6. **Enable anonymous read access** for public/status dashboards where appropriate

We will start with Grafana Cloud free tier for initial development and migrate to self-hosted Grafana when scaling.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Industry Standard**: De facto standard for metrics visualization with Prometheus
- **Rich Visualizations**: Extensive panel types (graphs, gauges, heatmaps, tables, etc.)
- **Multi-Data Source**: Can combine Prometheus, Loki (logs), Tempo (traces), and databases
- **Powerful Templating**: Variables and templates enable dynamic, reusable dashboards
- **Active Development**: Regular updates with new features and improvements
- **Strong Community**: Large library of pre-built dashboards available
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extensible with custom panels and data sources
- **Alerting Integration**: Visual alert configuration with multiple notification channels
- **Free and Open Source**: No licensing costs for self-hosted deployment

### Negative

- **Operational Overhead**: Requires deployment, backup, and maintenance
- **Learning Curve**: Complex features require time to master
- **Performance Considerations**: Heavy dashboards can impact browser and server performance
- **Version Management**: Dashboard changes need careful version control
- **Initial Setup Time**: Creating comprehensive dashboards requires significant investment

### Neutral

- **Storage Requirements**: Needs persistent storage for dashboards and configuration
- **Authentication Integration**: Requires setup for team-based access control
- **Upgrade Management**: Regular updates need testing and planning
- **Resource Usage**: Can be resource-intensive with many concurrent users

## Alternatives Considered

### Prometheus Built-in UI

Prometheus includes a basic web UI for queries and graphs.

**Pros:**
- No additional deployment
- Direct PromQL interface
- Lightweight
- Always in sync with Prometheus

**Cons:**
- Very basic visualizations
- No dashboard persistence
- No multi-query views
- No sharing capabilities
- Not suitable for non-technical users

**Why not chosen:** Too limited for our comprehensive monitoring needs.

### Kibana

Elastic's visualization platform, primarily for Elasticsearch.

**Pros:**
- Powerful for log analysis
- Good for full-text search
- Part of ELK stack
- Rich visualizations

**Cons:**
- Primarily designed for Elasticsearch
- Less optimal for metrics
- Requires Elasticsearch deployment
- Different query language

**Why not chosen:** Not optimal for Prometheus metrics and would require additional infrastructure.

### Datadog Dashboards

Commercial monitoring platform with integrated dashboards.

**Pros:**
- Fully managed
- Excellent UX
- Integrated with Datadog metrics
- No operational overhead
- Advanced analytics features

**Cons:**
- Expensive at scale
- Vendor lock-in
- Requires sending data to cloud
- Less flexibility in customization

**Why not chosen:** Cost and data sovereignty concerns, plus vendor lock-in risks.

### Custom Dashboard Solution

Building our own visualization layer.

**Pros:**
- Complete control
- Tailored to exact needs
- No external dependencies
- Deep integration possible

**Cons:**
- Massive development effort
- Maintenance burden
- Reinventing the wheel
- No community support
- Opportunity cost

**Why not chosen:** The effort required would detract from our core platform development.

## Implementation Notes

### Grafana Configuration

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml excerpt
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:10.2.0
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  environment:
    - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
    - GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=grafana-piechart-panel
  volumes:
    - ./grafana/provisioning:/etc/grafana/provisioning
    - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana
```

### Dashboard Provisioning

```yaml
# grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboard.yml
apiVersion: 1

providers:
  - name: 'DIP Dashboards'
    orgId: 1
    folder: 'DIP'
    type: file
    disableDeletion: true
    updateIntervalSeconds: 10
    options:
      path: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards
```

### Standard Dashboard Structure

Each service gets standard dashboards:

1. **Service Overview Dashboard**
   - RED metrics (Request rate, Error rate, Duration)
   - Resource utilization
   - Key business metrics
   - Recent alerts

2. **SLO Compliance Dashboard**
   - Error budget consumption
   - SLI trends
   - Availability metrics
   - Latency percentiles

3. **Business Metrics Dashboard**
   - Events processed
   - Classification distribution
   - Processing pipeline health
   - Cost metrics

### Example Dashboard JSON

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "DIP Service Overview",
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "Request Rate",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "rate(service_requests_total[$__rate_interval])",
            "legendFormat": "{{service}} - {{method}}"
          }
        ],
        "gridPos": {"h": 8, "w": 12, "x": 0, "y": 0}
      },
      {
        "title": "Error Rate",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "rate(service_requests_total{status=~\"5..\"}[$__rate_interval])",
            "legendFormat": "{{service}}"
          }
        ],
        "gridPos": {"h": 8, "w": 12, "x": 12, "y": 0}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Alert Configuration

```yaml
# Example alert rule in Grafana
alert: HighErrorRate
expr: rate(service_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
for: 5m
annotations:
  summary: "High error rate detected"
  description: "{{ $labels.service }} has error rate of {{ $value }}"
```

### Dashboard Best Practices

1. **Use consistent layouts** across similar dashboards
2. **Include documentation** in text panels explaining metrics
3. **Set appropriate time ranges** as dashboard defaults
4. **Use variables** for service/environment selection
5. **Implement drill-down** capabilities with dashboard links
6. **Version control** dashboard JSON in git
7. **Regular review** and cleanup of unused dashboards

### Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Grafana Cloud free tier (current)
   - Quick setup for development
   - No operational overhead
   - Learn Grafana features

2. **Phase 2**: Self-hosted Grafana
   - When exceeding free tier limits
   - Full control over data
   - Custom plugins possible

3. **Phase 3**: Grafana Enterprise (if needed)
   - Advanced features
   - Support contract
   - Enhanced security features
