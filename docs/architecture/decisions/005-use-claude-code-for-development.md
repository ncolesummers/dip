# ADR-005: Use Claude Code for AI-Assisted Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Modern software development increasingly benefits from AI assistance to accelerate development, improve code quality, and reduce cognitive load. The Deno Intelligence Platform requires rapid iteration and high-quality code across multiple microservices. We need a development assistance tool that:

- **Understands our entire codebase** context, not just individual files
- **Provides intelligent code generation** that follows our patterns and conventions
- **Assists with complex refactoring** across multiple files
- **Helps maintain consistency** across our microservices architecture
- **Accelerates debugging** and problem-solving
- **Supports our technology stack** (Deno, TypeScript, Docker, etc.)

Key considerations:

- Developer productivity is crucial for project velocity
- Code consistency across services is essential for maintainability
- Onboarding new developers should be streamlined
- AI assistance should enhance, not replace, developer judgment
- Security and privacy of our codebase must be maintained

## Decision

We will adopt Claude Code as our standard AI-assisted development tool for the DIP project.

Claude Code will be used for:

1. **Code Generation**: Creating new services, components, and features
2. **Code Review Assistance**: Identifying patterns, bugs, and improvements
3. **Documentation**: Generating and maintaining technical documentation
4. **Refactoring**: Large-scale code improvements and modernization
5. **Debugging**: Analyzing complex issues and suggesting solutions
6. **Learning**: Helping developers understand unfamiliar code or technologies

Integration approach:

- Configure Claude Code with our project context and conventions
- Establish guidelines for appropriate AI assistance use
- Document patterns that work well with AI assistance
- Create templates for common AI-assisted tasks

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Increased Velocity**: Faster implementation of features and bug fixes
- **Improved Consistency**: AI helps maintain coding patterns across the codebase
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on architecture and business logic
- **Better Documentation**: AI assists in keeping documentation up-to-date
- **Knowledge Transfer**: AI helps explain complex code sections
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick exploration of implementation approaches
- **Enhanced Debugging**: AI can spot patterns humans might miss
- **Continuous Learning**: Developers learn from AI suggestions

### Negative

- **Over-reliance Risk**: Developers might become too dependent on AI assistance
- **Context Limitations**: AI may not fully understand all business requirements
- **Code Review Overhead**: AI-generated code requires careful review
- **Privacy Concerns**: Codebase information is processed by external service
- **Cost Considerations**: Potential subscription or usage costs

### Neutral

- **Workflow Adjustment**: Teams need to adapt development practices
- **Learning Curve**: Effective AI prompting requires practice
- **Quality Variance**: Output quality depends on prompt quality
- **Tool Evolution**: Rapid changes in AI capabilities require adaptation

## Alternatives Considered

### GitHub Copilot

Microsoft's AI pair programmer integrated with popular IDEs.

**Pros:**

- Deep IDE integration
- Large training dataset
- Good for line-by-line completion
- Wide language support

**Cons:**

- Limited context awareness
- Primarily autocomplete focused
- Less capable for complex refactoring
- No direct codebase understanding

**Why not chosen:** Lacks the comprehensive codebase understanding and complex task handling capabilities of Claude Code.

### ChatGPT Plus

OpenAI's general-purpose AI assistant.

**Pros:**

- General purpose flexibility
- Good for explanations
- Wide knowledge base
- Regular updates

**Cons:**

- No codebase integration
- Limited context window
- Not specialized for coding
- Manual copy-paste workflow

**Why not chosen:** Lacks specialized coding features and codebase integration.

### Amazon CodeWhisperer

Amazon's AI coding companion.

**Pros:**

- AWS integration
- Security scanning
- Free tier available
- IDE integration

**Cons:**

- Limited to specific IDEs
- Less sophisticated than Claude
- AWS-centric focus
- Smaller training dataset

**Why not chosen:** Less capable for complex tasks and limited ecosystem support.

### No AI Assistance

Traditional development without AI tools.

**Pros:**

- No external dependencies
- Complete control
- No privacy concerns
- No additional costs

**Cons:**

- Slower development
- More manual work
- Higher cognitive load
- Missed optimization opportunities

**Why not chosen:** The productivity gains from AI assistance are too significant to ignore.

## Implementation Notes

### Usage Guidelines

```markdown
## Claude Code Usage Guidelines

### Appropriate Use Cases

✅ Generating boilerplate code
✅ Implementing well-defined features
✅ Writing tests for existing code
✅ Refactoring for better patterns
✅ Debugging complex issues
✅ Creating documentation
✅ Learning new technologies

### Inappropriate Use Cases

❌ Security-critical code without review
❌ Business logic without understanding
❌ Blindly accepting suggestions
❌ Replacing code review process
```

### Project Configuration

Create `.claude/claude.md` for project context:

```markdown
# DIP Project Context

## Architecture

- Deno-based microservices
- Event-driven with CloudEvents
- Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- Kafka message bus

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript strict mode
- Zod for validation
- BaseService pattern for services
- Comprehensive error handling

## Key Patterns

- Use shared/ for common code
- Follow ADRs for decisions
- Write tests for all features
- Document public APIs
```

### Prompt Templates

```typescript
// Feature Implementation Template
`
Create a new [feature] for the [service] service that:
1. Follows the existing BaseService pattern
2. Includes Zod validation for inputs
3. Emits CloudEvents for state changes
4. Includes Prometheus metrics
5. Has comprehensive error handling
6. Includes unit tests

Context: [business requirements]
`;

// Debugging Template
`
Debug this issue in [service]:
- Error: [error message]
- Context: [when it occurs]
- Expected: [expected behavior]
- Current code: [relevant code]

Consider:
- Recent changes
- Service dependencies
- Event flow
- Configuration issues
`;
```

### Code Review Process

1. **Human Review Required**: All AI code must be reviewed
2. **Testing Mandatory**: AI-generated code needs comprehensive tests
3. **Documentation**: Document any AI-specific patterns used

### Security Considerations

- Never share credentials or secrets with AI
- Review all external API calls in generated code
- Validate all input handling in AI suggestions
- Audit dependencies suggested by AI
- Keep sensitive business logic human-written

### Metrics for Success

Track AI assistance effectiveness:

- Development velocity changes
- Code quality metrics
- Bug rates in AI-assisted vs manual code
- Developer satisfaction scores
- Time to implement features

### Team Training

1. **Prompt Engineering Workshop**: Teaching effective AI interaction
2. **Best Practices Documentation**: Maintaining AI usage guidelines
3. **Pattern Library**: Collecting successful AI prompts
4. **Regular Reviews**: Assessing AI tool effectiveness
