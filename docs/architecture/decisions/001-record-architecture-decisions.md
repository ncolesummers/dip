# ADR-001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Deno Intelligence Platform (DIP) is a complex microservices architecture that will evolve over time. As the system grows and team members change, we face several challenges:

- **Knowledge Loss**: When developers leave or move to other projects, their understanding of why certain decisions were made often leaves with them
- **Decision Fatigue**: Without documented past decisions, teams waste time reconsidering previously solved problems
- **Onboarding Difficulty**: New team members struggle to understand the system's design rationale, leading to longer ramp-up times
- **Architectural Drift**: Without clear documentation, the architecture can drift from its intended design through incremental changes
- **Inconsistent Decision Making**: Different team members might make contradictory decisions due to lack of awareness of existing patterns

We need a lightweight, sustainable way to capture and communicate the architectural decisions that shape our system.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following Michael Nygard's format to document all significant architectural decisions. 

Specifically, we will:

1. **Store ADRs in the repository** at `docs/architecture/decisions/` to keep them versioned with the code
2. **Number ADRs sequentially** (001, 002, 003...) for easy reference and chronological tracking
3. **Write ADRs in Markdown** for simplicity, readability, and compatibility with version control
4. **Include ADRs in code reviews** when introducing architectural changes
5. **Link to ADRs from code** where the decision impacts implementation

An architectural decision is "significant" if it:
- Affects the structure or behavior of the system
- Introduces new technologies, frameworks, or patterns
- Changes development or deployment workflows
- Would surprise a new developer if undocumented
- Has long-term implications for maintainability or scalability

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Preserved Context**: Future developers understand not just what was decided, but why
- **Improved Decision Quality**: Writing ADRs forces thoughtful consideration of alternatives and trade-offs
- **Faster Onboarding**: New team members can read ADRs to understand the system's evolution
- **Accountability**: Decisions are transparent and attributable
- **Living Documentation**: ADRs evolve with the codebase through version control
- **Searchable History**: Easy to find relevant decisions using standard text search tools

### Negative

- **Writing Overhead**: Creating thoughtful ADRs takes time and effort
- **Maintenance Burden**: ADRs may need updates as decisions evolve
- **Process Friction**: Adds a step to the development workflow

### Neutral

- **Cultural Shift**: Requires team commitment to documentation as a first-class concern
- **Quality Variance**: ADR quality depends on the author's writing skills and thoroughness
- **Review Process**: ADRs become another artifact requiring review

## Alternatives Considered

### Wiki or Confluence Documentation

External documentation platforms separate from the codebase.

**Pros:**
- Rich formatting capabilities
- Easy to organize hierarchically
- Good for non-technical stakeholders

**Cons:**
- Tends to become stale quickly
- Not versioned with code
- Requires separate access management
- Creates context switching

**Why not chosen:** The separation from code leads to poor maintenance and eventual abandonment.

### Code Comments

Documenting decisions directly in code comments.

**Pros:**
- Closest to the implementation
- No additional tooling needed
- Automatically versioned

**Cons:**
- Scattered across codebase
- No standard format
- Hard to get overview of all decisions
- Limited space for comprehensive context

**Why not chosen:** Lacks the structure and discoverability needed for architectural decisions.

### No Formal Documentation

Relying on tribal knowledge and informal communication.

**Pros:**
- No overhead
- Maximum flexibility
- No process to follow

**Cons:**
- Knowledge is lost when people leave
- Decisions are reconsidered repeatedly
- Onboarding is difficult
- No accountability

**Why not chosen:** The long-term costs far outweigh the short-term convenience.

### Design Documents

Traditional design documents in various formats.

**Pros:**
- Can be very comprehensive
- Good for complex systems
- Industry standard in many organizations

**Cons:**
- Heavy-weight process
- Often become outdated
- Typically written once and forgotten
- High barrier to entry

**Why not chosen:** Too heavy for the iterative nature of our development process.

## Implementation Notes

### Creating a New ADR

```bash
# Copy the template
cp docs/architecture/decisions/adr-template.md \
   docs/architecture/decisions/XXX-decision-title.md

# Edit the new ADR
# Commit with the implementation
git add docs/architecture/decisions/XXX-decision-title.md
git commit -m "docs: Add ADR-XXX for [decision title]"
```

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet accepted
2. **Accepted**: Decision has been agreed upon and should be followed
3. **Deprecated**: No longer relevant but kept for historical context
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR (must reference the new ADR)

### When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when:
- Selecting a new technology or framework
- Defining a significant pattern or practice
- Making trade-offs between quality attributes
- Choosing between multiple viable alternatives
- Responding to a significant failure or incident

### Linking from Code

Reference ADRs in code comments where relevant:

```typescript
// Following ADR-013 BaseService pattern for consistency
export class IngestionService extends BaseService {
  // ...
}
```
