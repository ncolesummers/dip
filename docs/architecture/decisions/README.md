# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Deno Intelligence Platform (DIP). ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the system.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help future developers understand not just *what* decisions were made, but *why* they were made.

## ADR Index

### Foundation & Process
- [ADR-001: Record Architecture Decisions](./001-record-architecture-decisions.md) - **Accepted**  
  Establishes the practice of using ADRs to document architectural decisions

### Core Technology Stack

- [ADR-006: Use DevContainers for Development Environment](./006-use-devcontainers.md) - **Accepted**  
  Implements DevContainers for consistent development environments

### Architecture Patterns
- [ADR-007: Adopt Event-Driven Architecture](./007-adopt-event-driven-architecture.md) - **Accepted**  
  Implements event-driven architecture with publish-subscribe patterns for loose coupling

- [ADR-008: Use CloudEvents Specification](./008-use-cloudevents-specification.md) - **Accepted**  
  Adopts CloudEvents v1.0 for standardized event format across services

- [ADR-009: Use Apache Kafka for Message Bus](./009-use-kafka-for-messaging.md) - **Accepted**  
  Uses Kafka as the central message broker for event streaming

- [ADR-010: Use Zod for Runtime Validation](./010-use-zod-for-validation.md) - **Accepted**  
  Implements Zod for runtime validation with TypeScript type inference

- [ADR-011: Use Hono Web Framework](./011-use-hono-web-framework.md) - **Accepted**  
  Adopts Hono as the web framework for all HTTP APIs

- [ADR-012: Adopt Microservices Pattern](./012-adopt-microservices-pattern.md) - **Accepted**  
  Decomposes system into independently deployable microservices

- [ADR-013: Implement BaseService Abstraction](./013-implement-baseservice-abstraction.md) - **Accepted**  
  Provides common functionality through BaseService abstract class

- [ADR-014: Use Structured JSON Logging](./014-use-structured-json-logging.md) - **Accepted**  
  Implements structured JSON logging for machine-readable logs

## How to Use ADRs

### Reading ADRs
1. Start with ADR-001 to understand why we use ADRs
2. Read ADRs relevant to your work area
3. Check the status (Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
4. Pay attention to the Consequences section for trade-offs

### Creating New ADRs

1. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp adr-template.md XXX-short-title.md
   ```

2. **Fill in all sections**:
   - Context: What problem are we solving?
   - Decision: What are we doing?
   - Consequences: What are the trade-offs?
   - Alternatives: What else did we consider?

3. **Submit for review**:
   - Create PR with the new ADR
   - Include implementation if applicable
   - Get team consensus

### When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when you:
- Select a new technology or tool
- Define a significant pattern
- Make security or performance trade-offs
- Change development processes
- Replace existing technology

## ADR Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet accepted
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and should be followed
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant but kept for history
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR (will reference the new ADR)

## Tools and Resources

### Viewing ADRs
- Read directly in GitHub/GitLab
- Use VS Code with Markdown preview
- Generate static site with tools like ADR-tools

## Contributing

When creating or modifying ADRs:
1. Follow the template structure
2. Be concise but thorough
3. Include concrete examples where helpful
4. Link to relevant documentation
5. Consider long-term implications

## Questions?

If you have questions about ADRs or architectural decisions:
1. Check existing ADRs first
2. Discuss in team meetings
3. Create a Proposed ADR for significant new decisions
4. Reach out to the architecture team
