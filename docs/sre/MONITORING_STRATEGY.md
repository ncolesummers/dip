## Tool Selection

### Recommended Stack for MVP

#### Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana Cloud Free

**Why This Choice:**
- **Prometheus**: Already integrated (see metrics.ts)
- **Grafana Cloud Free**: 10,000 series, 14-day retention
- **Cost**: $0 for MVP, scales to ~$50/month
- **Migration Path**: Easy to self-host later

**Configuration Approach:**
```yaml
# Remote write to Grafana Cloud
prometheus:
  remote_write:
    - url: https://prometheus-us-central1.grafana.net/api/prom/push
      basic_auth:
        username: <instance-id>
        password: <api-key>
      write_relabel_configs:
        # Only send important metrics to cloud
        - source_labels: [__name__]
          regex: '(up|http_.*|events_.*|tickets_.*)'
          action: keep
```

#### Logging: Console JSON + Loki (Future)

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
```typescript
// Structured JSON logging to stdout
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  level: "info",
  service: "ingestion",
  trace_id: "abc123",
  message: "Ticket processed",
  ticket_id: "TKT-001",
  duration_ms: 145
}));
```

**Phase 2 (Growth):**
- Add Loki for log aggregation
- Grafana for log visualization
- Cost: ~$20/month for 50GB

#### Tracing: OpenTelemetry + Jaeger

**Why This Choice:**
- **OpenTelemetry**: Vendor-neutral, future-proof
- **Jaeger**: Free, easy to run, good enough for MVP
- **Alternative**: Grafana Tempo when scaling

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Basic OpenTelemetry setup
import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api';

const tracer = trace.getTracer('dip-service');
const span = tracer.startSpan('process-ticket');
// ... processing logic
span.end();
```

#### Error Tracking: Sentry Open Source

**Why This Choice:**
- **Self-hosted option**: Free and private
- **Great developer experience**: Excellent error grouping
- **Deno support**: Official SDK available
- **Alternative**: Grafana Cloud Errors (when available)

## Dashboard Strategy

### Audience-Specific Dashboards

#### 1. Developer Dashboard (Primary Audience)

**Purpose**: Day-to-day development and debugging

**Key Panels:**
- Service health status grid (red/yellow/green)
- Recent deployments timeline
- Error rate by service (last hour)
- Slowest endpoints (p95 latency)
- Active alerts
- Recent error samples with stack traces

**Update Frequency**: 30 seconds
**Time Range**: Last 3 hours default

#### 2. Operations Dashboard

**Purpose**: System health and performance monitoring

**Key Panels:**
- Golden signals overview (all services)
- SLO burn-down charts
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- Kafka lag by topic
- Database connection pool status
- Network I/O rates

**Update Frequency**: 1 minute
**Time Range**: Last 24 hours default

#### 3. Business Dashboard

**Purpose**: Product metrics and user activity

**Key Panels:**
- Tickets created/resolved (hourly)
- Classification distribution (intent types)
- Auto-resolution rate trend
- User satisfaction metrics (if available)
- Top error messages seen by users
- Geographic distribution (if applicable)

**Update Frequency**: 5 minutes
**Time Range**: Last 7 days default

#### 4. On-Call Dashboard

**Purpose**: Incident response and triage

**Key Panels:**
- Alert status (firing, pending, resolved)
- Service dependencies map
- Recent changes (deployments, configs)
- Anomaly detection highlights
- Runbook links for active alerts
- Contact information for escalation

**Update Frequency**: 10 seconds
**Time Range**: Last 1 hour default

### Dashboard Design Principles

```yaml
Glanceability:
  - Critical info visible in 5 seconds
  - Color coding: red=bad, yellow=warning, green=good
  - Large, readable fonts
  - No scrolling for key metrics

Context:
  - Include normal ranges
  - Show week-over-week comparisons
  - Annotate deployments and incidents
  - Link to relevant documentation

Actionability:
  - Each panel answers a specific question
  - Include "what to do" in panel descriptions
  - Link to runbooks for problem resolution
  - Drill-down capability to details
```

## Alert Routing Strategy

### Alert Channels by Environment

#### Development Environment
```yaml
Channels:
  - Console logs (all alerts)
  - Developer Slack channel (critical only)
  - No paging

Suppression:
  - Business hours only
  - Maintenance windows auto-detected
  - Batch similar alerts (5-minute window)
```

#### Staging Environment
```yaml
Channels:
  - Email to dev team list
  - Slack #staging-alerts channel
  - Dashboard annotations

Escalation:
  - No escalation in staging
  - Weekly summary report
```

#### Production Environment (Future)
```yaml
Primary:
  - PagerDuty or Opsgenie (free tier)
  - Slack #production-alerts
  - Email to on-call

Escalation Path:
  1. On-call engineer (0 minutes)
  2. Backup on-call (15 minutes)
  3. Team lead (30 minutes)
  4. Incident commander (45 minutes)

Integration:
  - Auto-create tickets for incidents
  - Update status page
  - Post-mortem tracking
```

### Alert Routing Rules

```typescript
// Conceptual routing logic
function routeAlert(alert: Alert) {
  if (alert.severity === 'critical' && env === 'production') {
    return ['pagerduty', 'slack-urgent', 'email'];
  }
  
  if (alert.severity === 'warning') {
    return ['slack-monitoring', 'email-daily-digest'];
  }
  
  if (alert.labels.service === 'experimental') {
    return ['slack-dev-only'];
  }
  
  return ['dashboard-only'];
}
```

## Cost Management

### Estimated Costs by Stage

#### MVP (0-6 months)
```yaml
Grafana Cloud Free: $0
Jaeger (self-hosted): $0
Sentry (self-hosted): $0
Total: $0/month
```

#### Growth (6-12 months)
```yaml
Grafana Cloud Pro: $50/month
Loki (logs): $20/month
Additional storage: $10/month
Total: $80/month
```

#### Scale (12+ months)
```yaml
Self-hosted stack: $200/month (infrastructure)
Or Managed services: $300-500/month
Redundancy: +50%
Total: $300-750/month
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Metrics Cardinality Control**
   ```typescript
   // Limit label combinations
   const labels = {
     service: serviceName,
     method: httpMethod,
     // Don't include: user_id, request_id, etc.
   };
   ```

2. **Sampling Strategies**
   ```typescript
   // Sample traces (not all requests)
   const shouldTrace = Math.random() < 0.01; // 1% sampling
   ```

3. **Retention Policies**
   ```yaml
   Metrics:
     Raw: 15 days
     5-minute: 30 days
     1-hour: 90 days
     1-day: 1 year
   
   Logs:
     Debug: 1 day
     Info: 7 days
     Error: 30 days
   ```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Over-Monitoring
- Don't monitor everything, focus on what matters
- Avoid vanity metrics that don't drive action
- Resist the urge to create dashboards nobody uses

### Under-Monitoring
- Don't skip instrumentation "to save time"
- Don't ignore business metrics
- Don't forget about dependencies

### Poor Practices
- Avoid noisy alerts that train people to ignore them
- Don't create write-only dashboards
- Don't skip documentation and training
- Avoid vendor lock-in without escape plan
