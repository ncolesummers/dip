# Service Level Objectives (SLO) Planning for DIP

## Executive Summary

This document defines proposed Service Level Objectives for the Deno Intelligence Platform. These SLOs balance reliability expectations with development velocity, considering the constraints of an open-source project while maintaining professional standards.

---

## Core Principles

1. **User-Centric**: SLOs reflect actual user experience, not technical metrics
2. **Achievable**: Targets are realistic given resources and architecture
3. **Measurable**: Every SLO has clear, automated measurement
4. **Actionable**: Violations trigger specific responses
5. **Evolutionary**: Start conservative, tighten as system matures

---

## Proposed Service Level Objectives

### 1. Platform Availability

#### Definition

The percentage of time the platform successfully accepts and processes tickets.

#### Proposed SLO Targets

**Development Environment**

- **Target**: 95% availability
- **Measurement Window**: Daily
- **Error Budget**: 36 minutes/day
- **Rationale**: Development needs flexibility for testing and updates

**Staging Environment**

- **Target**: 99% availability
- **Measurement Window**: Weekly
- **Error Budget**: 1.68 hours/week
- **Rationale**: More stable than dev, but still allows for experimentation

**Production Environment (Future)**

- **Target**: 99.9% availability
- **Measurement Window**: Monthly
- **Error Budget**: 43.2 minutes/month
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for user-facing services

#### Measurement Method

```typescript
// Availability = Successful Requests / Total Requests
// Where "Successful" means HTTP 2xx or 3xx response
// Excluding client errors (4xx) from denominator

availability = (
  requests_with_status_2xx + requests_with_status_3xx
) / (
  total_requests - requests_with_status_4xx
) * 100;
```

#### Why 99.9% for Production?

- **Industry Standard**: Most B2B SaaS targets 99.9%
- **User Expectations**: 8.76 hours downtime/year is tolerable
- **Cost-Effective**: 99.95% requires significant investment
- **Open Source Reality**: Volunteer maintenance windows needed
- **Error Budget Usage**: Allows for ~10 deployments/month

---

### 2. Request Latency

#### Definition

The time taken to respond to HTTP requests at various percentiles.

#### Proposed SLO Targets

**Ticket Submission (POST /api/tickets)**

- **p50**: < 100ms (99% of time)
- **p95**: < 500ms (95% of time)
- **p99**: < 2000ms (90% of time)
- **Measurement**: HTTP request to response time

**Health Checks (GET /health)**

- **p99**: < 50ms (99.9% of time)
- **Rationale**: Critical for load balancer decisions

**API Queries (GET endpoints)**

- **p50**: < 200ms (99% of time)
- **p95**: < 1000ms (95% of time)
- **p99**: < 3000ms (90% of time)

#### Multi-Window Approach

```typescript
// SLO compliance measured across multiple windows
- 1 hour: 99% of requests meet latency target
- 24 hours: 95% of requests meet latency target
- 7 days: 90% of requests meet latency target
```

#### Why These Percentiles?

- **p50**: Typical user experience
- **p95**: Catches degradation before users complain
- **p99**: Identifies systemic issues vs outliers
- **Not p99.9**: Too noisy for small request volumes

---

### 3. Event Processing Success Rate

#### Definition

The percentage of events successfully processed without entering dead letter queues.

#### Proposed SLO Targets

**Critical Events** (ticket.received, intent.classified)

- **Target**: 99.5% success rate
- **Window**: Rolling 24 hours
- **Error Budget**: 0.5% can fail and retry

**Standard Events** (analytics, notifications)

- **Target**: 99% success rate
- **Window**: Rolling 24 hours
- **Error Budget**: 1% acceptable loss

**Best-Effort Events** (telemetry, debugging)

- **Target**: 95% success rate
- **Window**: Rolling 7 days
- **Error Budget**: 5% can be dropped

#### Measurement Method

```typescript
// Success Rate = Successfully Processed / Total Attempted
// Excludes validation errors (client faults)

success_rate = (
  events_processed_success /
  (events_processed_success + events_processed_failure)
) * 100;
```

---

### 4. Data Freshness

#### Definition

How quickly data becomes available after submission.

#### Proposed SLO Targets

**Ticket Classification**

- **Target**: 95% classified within 5 seconds
- **Critical**: 99.9% classified within 30 seconds
- **Rationale**: Users expect quick initial response

**Search Index Updates**

- **Target**: 90% indexed within 1 minute
- **Acceptable**: 99% indexed within 5 minutes
- **Rationale**: Near real-time search is valuable but not critical

**Analytics Aggregation**

- **Target**: Updated every 5 minutes
- **Rationale**: Business metrics don't need real-time precision

## Error Budget Policy

### Budget Allocation Strategy

#### Monthly Error Budget Distribution

```yaml
Planned Maintenance: 30%
  - Scheduled updates
  - Database migrations
  - Infrastructure changes

Feature Deployments: 40%
  - New service rollouts
  - API changes
  - Schema updates

Unplanned Incidents: 30%
  - Unexpected failures
  - External dependencies
  - Traffic spikes
```

### Budget Exhaustion Response

#### At 50% Budget Consumed

- Review recent changes for issues
- Increase monitoring verbosity
- Document lessons learned

#### At 75% Budget Consumed

- Freeze non-critical deployments
- Focus on reliability improvements
- Conduct incident review

#### At 100% Budget Consumed

- Stop all feature work
- Full team focus on reliability
- Post-mortem required
- Executive review triggered

## Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

### Alert Priority Levels

#### Page (Immediate Response Required)

- Multiple services down
- Error budget exhaustion imminent
- Data loss detected
- Security breach indicators

#### Ticket (Within 4 Hours)

- Single service degraded
- 50% error budget consumed
- Latency SLO violation
- Queue backing up

#### Email (Next Business Day)

- Error budget trending bad
- Capacity warnings
- Configuration drift
- Documentation updates needed

### Alert Fatigue Prevention

- No alerts on single errors
- Multi-window burn rate alerts
- Business hours consideration
- Automatic alert suppression during maintenance

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits of These SLOs

- **Clear Expectations**: Users know what to expect
- **Prioritization Framework**: Error budget guides decisions
- **Quality Gateway**: Prevents "move fast and break things"
- **Team Alignment**: Shared understanding of "good enough"

### Costs and Trade-offs

- **Development Velocity**: ~20% slower feature delivery
- **Monitoring Overhead**: ~2 hours/week maintaining dashboards
- **On-Call Burden**: Requires rotation for incident response
- **Infrastructure Cost**: Monitoring stack adds ~$50-100/month

---

## Stakeholder Communication

### For Developers

"SLOs define 'good enough' - meet them and ship with confidence"

### For Users

"Expect 99.9% uptime with most requests completing in under 500ms"

### For Contributors

"Focus on reliability first, features second when budget is tight"

### For Leadership

"Balanced approach to reliability vs velocity with clear trade-offs"

## Appendix: Rationale for Open Source Constraints

### Why Not 99.99%?

1. **Volunteer Maintenance**: Can't guarantee 24/7 coverage
2. **Limited Resources**: No dedicated SRE team
3. **Cost Constraints**: High availability is expensive
4. **User Expectations**: Open source users are forgiving
5. **Complexity Trade-off**: Simplicity over five nines

### Development vs Production Standards

**Development SLOs** (What we start with):

- Focus on learning and iteration
- Generous error budgets
- Simple monitoring
- Manual processes OK

**Production SLOs** (What we grow into):

- Stricter targets based on real data
- Automated enforcement
- Complex monitoring
- Full automation required

---

## Success Metrics for SLO Program

After 6 months, we should see:

- **90% SLO achievement** across all services
- **50% reduction in MTTR** due to clear targets
- **80% of incidents** detected by SLO alerts
- **Zero severity-1 incidents** from SLO violations
- **Positive developer feedback** on error budget approach

---

_These SLOs are proposals for team discussion. Final targets should be set based on:_

- _Actual baseline measurements_
- _User feedback and expectations_
- _Available resources and tooling_
- _Business priorities and roadmap_
