# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures that help keep
the community safe.

- Preferred contact: security reports via email to [nate@ncolesummers.com]
- Alternate contact: open a GitHub Security Advisory (private report) if enabled
  for this repo
- Do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest release on the `main` branch. If we publish
tagged releases, security fixes will be backported to the latest minor of the
last two minors when feasible.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| main    | Yes       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Please email [nate@ncolesummers.com] with a description of the issue, steps
   to reproduce, and any proof-of-concept code or logs. Include the version or
   commit SHA you tested against, and your environment details.
2. For sensitive reports, you may request encrypted communication (PGP) â€”
   include your preference and we will coordinate.
3. You should receive an acknowledgment within 3 business days. If you have not
   heard back, please follow up or, as a last resort, ping a maintainer using a
   minimal comment that does not reveal details.

## Disclosure Policy

- We will confirm the issue, assess impact/severity, and plan a fix. We aim to
  provide a fix within 90 days for most issues; critical issues may be
  prioritized sooner.
- We will keep you updated on progress. Once a fix is available, we will
  coordinate a disclosure date with you.
- When appropriate, we will publish a security advisory with CVE details and
  credits for reporters who wish to be acknowledged.

## Non-Goals

- This policy is not for support questions or general bug reports. Please use
  GitHub Issues for non-security topics.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against good-faith security researchers who
adhere to this policy and make a best effort to avoid privacy violations,
service degradation, or data destruction.
