- `evaluation` - Help us write better tests and benchmarks

Browse our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ncolesummers/dip/issues) to find
something that interests you!

### Understanding the Codebase

Before diving in, familiarize yourself with:

1. **Project Structure**: Review the README.md for an overview
2. **Architecture**: Read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) (when
   available)
3. **Existing Code**: Browse the `services/` and `shared/` directories
4. **Tests**: Look at existing tests in `tests/` to understand our testing
   approach

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

### Option 1: DevContainer (Recommended)

The fastest way to get a fully configured development environment:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ncolesummers/dip.git
   cd dip
   code .
   ```

3. **When VS Code opens**, you'll see a notification to "Reopen in Container".
   Click it!
   - Alternatively, use Command Palette (F1):
     `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`

4. **Wait for container to build** (first time takes ~5 minutes)
   - Installs Deno, Claude CLI, and all tools
   - Sets up VS Code with proper extensions
   - Configures git and environment

5. **Start developing**:
   ```bash
   # Inside the container terminal
   docker compose up -d  # Start Kafka, PostgreSQL, etc.
   deno task dev        # Start development
   ```

### Option 2: Local Development

If you prefer local development:

1. **Install Deno**:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

2. **Install Docker** for running infrastructure:
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

3. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ncolesummers/dip.git
   cd dip

   # Start infrastructure
   docker compose up -d

   # Install dependencies
   deno cache --reload import_map.json
   ```

4. **Configure your editor**:
   - **VS Code**: Install
     [Deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
   - **Other editors**: See
     [Deno's editor setup guide](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment)

### For AI Developers

We embrace AI-assisted development! If you're using Claude, GitHub Copilot, or
other AI tools:

1. **DevContainer includes Claude CLI** pre-installed
2. **Use AI for**:
   - Generating boilerplate code
   - Writing tests
   - Improving documentation
   - Refactoring suggestions

3. **Always**:
   - Review AI-generated code carefully
   - Ensure it follows our style guidelines
   - Add appropriate tests
   - Document AI assistance in PR descriptions when significant

## üîÑ Development Process

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates
- `test/*` - Test improvements

### Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature develop
   ```
3. **Make** your changes
4. **Test** your changes:
   ```bash
   deno test --allow-all
   deno lint
   deno fmt --check
   ```
5. **Commit** with meaningful messages
6. **Push** to your fork
7. **Open** a Pull Request to `develop`

## üß™ Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests. We use Deno's built-in testing
framework.

### Test Types

#### Unit Tests

Located in `tests/unit/`, these test individual functions and classes:

```typescript
// tests/unit/example.test.ts
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts";
import { processData } from "../../services/example/processor.ts";

Deno.test("processData transforms input correctly", () => {
  const input = { raw: "data" };
  const expected = { processed: "DATA" };
  assertEquals(processData(input), expected);
});
```

#### Integration Tests

Located in `tests/integration/`, these test service interactions:

```typescript
// tests/integration/service.test.ts
Deno.test("Service publishes event after processing", async () => {
  const service = new TestService();
  await service.start();

  const result = await service.processEvent(mockEvent);

  assertExists(result.correlationId);
  await service.stop();
});
```

#### Evaluation Suites

Located in `tests/evals/`, these are comprehensive test suites:

```typescript
// tests/evals/performance.eval.ts
Deno.test("Performance Evaluation Suite", async (t) => {
  await t.step("handles 1000 concurrent requests", async () => {
    // Performance test implementation
  });

  await t.step("maintains <100ms p99 latency", async () => {
    // Latency test implementation
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
deno test --allow-all

# Run specific test file
deno test tests/unit/example.test.ts --allow-all

# Run with coverage
deno test --allow-all --coverage=coverage

# Generate coverage report
deno coverage coverage --lcov > coverage.lcov
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **New features**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Bug fixes**: Include regression tests
- **Critical paths**: 90%+ coverage recommended

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

We use Deno's built-in formatter and linter. These are non-negotiable - code
must pass both before merging.

### TypeScript Guidelines

#### Use Explicit Types for Function Parameters

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
function processTicket(ticket: Ticket, priority: Priority): Promise<Result> {
  // Implementation
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
function processTicket(ticket, priority) {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Leverage Zod for Runtime Validation

```typescript
// Define schemas with Zod
import { z } from "zod";

export const TicketSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().regex(/^TKT-\d{6}$/),
  text: z.string().min(1).max(5000),
  priority: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]),
  createdAt: z.date().default(() => new Date()),
});

// Infer TypeScript types from schemas
export type Ticket = z.infer<typeof TicketSchema>;

// Validate at runtime
export function validateTicket(data: unknown): Ticket {
  return TicketSchema.parse(data);
}
```

#### Service Structure Pattern

```typescript
// services/my-service/service.ts
import { BaseService } from "../../shared/services/base.ts";
import { CloudEvent } from "../../shared/events/types.ts";

export class MyService extends BaseService {
  constructor() {
    super("my-service");
  }

  protected async onStart(): Promise<void> {
    // Initialize resources
    await this.connectToKafka();
  }

  protected async onStop(): Promise<void> {
    // Cleanup resources
    await this.disconnectFromKafka();
  }

  async processEvent(event: CloudEvent): Promise<void> {
    // Validate input
    const data = MySchema.parse(event.data);

    // Process
    const result = await this.process(data);

    // Publish result
    await this.publish("my.event.processed", result);
  }
}
```

#### Error Handling

```typescript
// Use custom error classes
export class ServiceError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code: string,
    public statusCode: number = 500,
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "ServiceError";
  }
}

// Handle errors appropriately
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ZodError) {
    // Handle validation errors
    logger.error("Validation failed", { error: error.errors });
    throw new ServiceError("Invalid input", "VALIDATION_ERROR", 400);
  }

  // Re-throw unexpected errors
  throw error;
}
```

### File Organization

- **One class/interface per file** (with related types)
- **Explicit exports** (no default exports except for main entry points)
- **Descriptive file names** (use kebab-case)
- **Group related files** in directories

### Import Guidelines

```typescript
// 1. Deno standard library
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts";

// 2. External dependencies (from import_map.json)
import { z } from "zod";
import { Hono } from "hono";

// 3. Shared modules (absolute paths from project root)
import { BaseService } from "../../shared/services/base.ts";
import { CloudEvent } from "../../shared/events/types.ts";

// 4. Local modules (relative paths)
import { processData } from "./processor.ts";
import type { Config } from "./types.ts";
```
